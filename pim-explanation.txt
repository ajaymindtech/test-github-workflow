
1. **Reduce Unauthorized Access**:
   - PIM helps in reducing the chances of unauthorized access by enforcing just-in-time access and requiring users to request access to privileged roles.
   - Users only get elevated permissions when needed, and those permissions are time-limited. This reduces the exposure to unauthorized users.

2. **Enhance Security**:
   - By utilizing PIM, you can enhance the security posture of your cloud infrastructure. Only authorized users are granted access to sensitive resources and roles.
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be enforced for activation, adding an extra layer of security.

3. **Mitigate the Risk of Human Error**:
   - PIM reduces the risk of authorized users accidentally causing damage to critical resources by providing just-in-time access.
   - Users need to provide justification when activating roles, which helps ensure that their actions are intentional and aligned with business needs.

4. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - PIM allows you to monitor the activation and usage of privileged roles in real-time.
   - Auditing and alerting capabilities help in identifying and responding to unusual activities or security incidents promptly.

5. **Early Adoption and Testing**:
   - Assigning early adopter users to PIM roles allows you to test and evaluate the functionality of PIM in a controlled environment.
   - Feedback from early adopters helps fine-tune your policies and configurations.

6. **Documentation and Compliance**:
   - PIM enables you to maintain a clear record of who has access to privileged roles and why.
   - This documentation can be crucial for compliance and audit purposes.

7. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - PIM complements Azure's built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) by adding an additional layer of access control for privileged roles.
   - Users can be assigned to roles on a temporary basis, reducing the risk of prolonged access.

8. **Scalability and Management**:
   - As you grow, PIM provides the flexibility to scale the management of privileged access to more roles and users.
   - It streamlines the assignment and monitoring process.

9. **User Accountability**:
   - Users are held accountable for their actions, as their justifications and role activations are tracked.

10. **Access Control Reviews**:
    - Regular reviews of privileged access can be conducted to ensure that access is still required and aligned with organizational needs.
